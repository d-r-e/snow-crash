extract pcap file from level02 home folder using scp
open with tshark -r level02.pcap > out.txt

filtering the output, a word "Password:" can be found, and next to it:

cat output |grep 040

66 74 5f 77 61 6e 64 72 7f 7f 7f 4e 44 52 65 6c 7f 4c 30 4c 0d

which converted to ascii results in 
"ft_waNDReL0L"
(7f are backspaces)
