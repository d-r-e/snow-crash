there is a perl script running on port 4747, which prints a parameter 'x'
this allows execution of a command passed as a parameter

curl localhost:4747?x='$(whoami)'
returns "flag04" which means the requests to this server are made from flag04 user.

if getflag gets evaluated from the script, which runs as user flag04,

	curl localhost:4747?x='$(getflag)'

results in the reveal of the flag.
